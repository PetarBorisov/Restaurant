# Restaurant
This is my first project with Spring Security. It is a restaurant application that aims to display the restaurant's services and the user to make a reservation for a given day and time, reserve a table and determine how many people will attend. In it I have implemented admin/user, fetch, validations and annotations, model mapper, working with Thymeleaf, intraceptor, scheduling and unit/integration tests.
