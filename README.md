# Restaurant
This is my first project with Spring Security. It is a restaurant application that aims to display the restaurant's services and the user to make a reservation for a given day and time, reserve a table and determine how many people will attend. In it I have implemented admin/user, fetch, validations and annotations,exeption handling, model mapper, working with Thymeleaf, intraceptor, scheduling and unit/integration tests.
The greater functionality in the project is given to the admin, he has the right to create admins from ordinary users and take away this right. In the project, DTOs are used to divide the layers, I also added annotations and validations to protect it from unintentional errors. The intraceptor I used is to keep statistics of logged in users, who and when logged into the application. The scheduler, on the other hand, deletes these statistics every 24 hours. The last two functions are available only to the admin. There is also a fetch request for writing comments, which are accessible for correction and deletion only by the admin. For communication between the backend and the frontend, I am used dynamic tool Thymeleaf,through it I have limited part of the visualization and I have limited the things that should not be seen by the user. In the project, I have done a not small percentage of code coverage with integration and unit tests.
